## Objective 

Create an interface (Content Management System aka CMS) that allows non-developers to easily view and ineract with information stored in databases. As a business owner I want them to be able to view and manage their departments, roles, and employees in their company so that they can organize and plan their business.

## Criteria
Given a command-line application that accepts user input, when I start the application, then I am presented with the following options: 
 - View all departments
 - View all roles, view all employees
 - Add a department
 - Add a role
 - Add an employee
 - Update an employee role 
When I choose to view all departments, then I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
When I choose to view all roles, then I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
When I choose to view all employees, then I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
When I choose to add a department, then I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
When I choose to add a role, then I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
When I choose to add an employee, then I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
When I choose to update an employee role, then I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
